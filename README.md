# MICard - A Flutter Business Card

I first began my Flutter journey creating this simple, single page application. It displays my business card laid out through the use of Flutter UI.

## What I learned

Through this single page app, I was able to grasp some of Flutters features.

- Statful vs Stateless Widgets
- Hot Reload vs Hot Refresh
- I learned to add custom fonts, and images into my app
- Using column and rows

## Technologies Used

- Flutter 1.9.1
